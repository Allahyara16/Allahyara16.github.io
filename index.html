        <h1>How to cook a healthy meals.</h1>
        
         <p>This website teach you how to cook and it will help you understand world cultures, customs and flavors. You will also learn life skills like eating healthy, budgeting your money, and cleaning. Save some cash. Cooking is less expensive than eating at restaurants, fast food joints and school cafeterias.

        
        
<h2>By learing how to cook, you can save money</h2>
        <P>Everyone is looking to save a few bucks here and there, but some of us may not be fully aware of how much $$ we are actually spending on our food choices each month.  When you think about it, the amount we spend on food is one of the very few monthly costs that we have control over. Wouldn’t you like to start saving a little each month to go on that trip you’ve been dreaming about? The more meals you prepare at home, the faster your travel fund can grow.
            
<h3>You’ll Likely Lose Weight.</h3>
            <p>Sounds a little crazy, right? Even if you eat the same amount of food at home as you eat when you go to restaurants or via takeout, you’re prone to lose weight because the amount of fat and calories consumed from home cooked meals is typically significantly less than anything you grab from the drive-thru.</p>
